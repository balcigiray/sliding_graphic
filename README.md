sliding_graphic
===============
This is an sliding bar graphic class for processing language.

One can use this class for serial port data input visualization. Graph slides in the screen smoothly. In most of the examples about data visualization, data is shown throughout the screen and then cleared all the data then repeat from beginning. But with this class continuous movement in the screen is obtained. 

Of course there will be another solutions to this problem but for now it is efficient enough to use in projects. This class is written especially for the inverted pendulum data visualization screen which can be found in one of my repositories.
